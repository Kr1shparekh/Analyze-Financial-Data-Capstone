# Analyze Financial Data with Python 🧠💹

This is my capstone project for the **Analyze Financial Data with Python** Skill Path. I worked as a simulated wealth manager helping a young client choose how to invest their money in a stock portfolio.

## 🔍 Project Overview

- Analyzed historical price and risk data from 5 major stocks (AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, AMZN, TSLA)
- Calculated daily returns, annualized returns, and volatility
- Visualized correlations to assess diversification
- Simulated 10,000 portfolios to identify optimal allocations
- Recommended 3 tailored portfolios (Conservative, Balanced, Aggressive)

## 📈 Visuals

- **Stock Prices (2020–2025)**  
- **Daily Returns**  
- **Correlation Heatmap**  
- **Efficient Frontier**  
- **Portfolio Allocations (Bar Charts)**

All plots are available in the `charts/` folder.

## 💼 Key Skills

- Python (pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, seaborn)
- Financial statistics
- Portfolio optimization (mean-variance)
- Data visualization
